                            What is <span class="sass-emphasis">Sass</span>?
                        </h2>
                        <p>The very first thing we need to to is to address the question of what exactly Sass is.  <a href="http://www.sass-lang.com" target="_blank">Sass</a>,
                        stands for Syntactically Asesome Style Sheets.  <em>"Oh, so sass is just CSS!"</em>, you may be thinking
                        to yourself.  Unfortunately, you're close but not quite there.  What Sass is, is a CSS preprocessor. This means, it lets you write
                        your CSS using a special syntax called SCSS (Sassy CSS), and when you're done, it compiles the SCSS into pure CSS that your browser can
                        understand. You may be thinking to yourself, "<em>If Sass just compiles into pure CSS, why not stick with that?</em>"
                        That's a great question! Keep on reading to find out.</p>
                    </section>


                    <section id="why">
                        <h2 class="sectionTitle">
                            <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-question-sign"></span>
                            Why should you use <span class="sass-emphasis">Sass</span>?
                        </h2>
                        <p>Probably the best reason to use Sass in the first place is CSS itself.  While functional in a "git-er-done"" kind of way, CSS
                        can be unruly and messy.  Writing the correct chain of selectors can be a headache and remembering the exact combination of hex
                        or RGB values you used to style a given element requires a lot of copying and pasting, or perfect memory.</p>
                        <p>CSS is admitedly not a programming language, but if we could introduce some of the ideas that make programming great, writing
                        stylesheets might become a more enjoyable process.  That's exactly where Sass steps in.</p>
                        <p>Because Sass is compiled into CSS, it allows for great features like variables, operators, and even functions!  Moreover,
                        The Sass framework allows you to write D.R.Y. stylesheets.  D.R.Y. stands for "Don't Repeat Yourself," and by introducing
                        features normally found in programming languages, Sass helps reduce the amount you actually have to write while styling your
                        sites.</p>

                    <section id="where">
                        <h2 class="sectionTitle">
                            <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-question-sign"></span>
                            Where can you use <span class="sass-emphasis">Sass</span>?
                        </h2>
                        <p>The compiled results of Sass stylesheet can
                        be used anywhere that normal CSS can be used, because it <em>is</em> normal CSS. In order to get the compiled results of a SCSS
                        stylesheet, you need the Sass compiler.</p>
                        <p>The Sass compiler was originally written in the Ruby programming language, but thanks to the hard work of some talented individuals,
                        Sass has been ported to a C/C++ library known as <a href="http://www.sass-lang.com/libsass" target="_blank">LibSass</a>.  The beauty of LibSass is that
                        it not only speeds up the compilation of Sass stylesheets (estimated to be <a href="http://www.moovweb.com/blog/libsass/" target="_blank">4000x faster</a>),
                        but it also enables integration with many other programming languages through wrappers written in the target language.  Want to
                        use Sass with Node.js? <a href="https://github.com/sass/node-sass" target="_blank">No problem!</a>  Interested in using Sass with C?  <a href="https://github.com/sass/sassc" target="_blank">
                        Easy!</a>  How about PHP?  <a href="https://github.com/sensational/sassphp" target='_blank'>Yup!</a>  As you can see, Not only is Sass useful, but LibSass
                        makes it incredibly portable and perfet for integrating with any of your projects.</p>

                                library up and running using the SassC command line wrapper.  Additionally, we'll ensure that you've got everything you need to build
                                and run a Node.js based web-server that uses Sass. If you're just interested in learning the basic syntax, you can skip this page alltogether.

                                <code>/* comments */</code>, <code>$variables</code>, operators, nesting, and the rules for using them.  When you finish this part of the how-to guide, you should
                                be able to look use Sass to accomplish what you already know how to do with plain CSS more efficiently.

                                your stylesheets DRY.  You'll learn about dividing your code into partials and importing those partials into your files.  You learn about the <code>@extend</code>
                                operator and how styles can inherit from other styles.  Then, you'll learn about the <code>@mixin</code> operator and how to create reusable rulesets that you can
                                <code>@include</code> into your stylesheets.  Finally, you'll learn a little about the <code>@function</code> operator and how to create your own functions.
