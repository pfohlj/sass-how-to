                            What is <span class="sass-emphasis">Sass</span>?
                        </h2>
                        <p>The very first thing we need to to is to address the question of what exactly Sass is.  <a href="http://www.sass-lang.com" target="_blank">Sass</a>
                        stands for Syntactically Asesome Style Sheets.  <em>"Oh, so sass is just CSS!"</em>, you may be thinking
                        to yourself.  Unfortunately, you're close but not quite there.  What Sass is, is a CSS preprocessor. This means, it lets you write
                        your CSS using a special syntax called SCSS, and then when you're done, it compiles the SCSS into pure CSS that your browser can
                        understand. You may be thinking to yourself, "<em>If Sass just compiles into pure CSS, why not just stick with that?</em>"
                        That's a great question! Keep on reading to find out.</p>
                    </section>


                    <section id="why">
                        <h2 class="sectionTitle">
                            <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-question-sign"></span>
                            Why should you use <span class="sass-emphasis">Sass</span>?
                        </h2>
                        <p>Probably the very best reason to use Sass in the first place is CSS itself.  While functional in a get-er-done kind of way, CSS
                        is often unruly and messy.  Writing the correct chain of selectors can be a headache and remembering the exact combination of hex
                        or RGB values you used to style a given element requires a lot of copying and pasting or perfect memory.</p>
                        <p>CSS is admitedly not a programming language, but if we could introduce some of the ideas that make programming great, writing
                        stylesheets might become a more enjoyable process.  That's exactly where Sass steps in.</p>
                        <p>Because Sass is compiled into CSS, it can allow for great features like variables, operators, and even functions!  Moreover,
                        The Sass framework allows you to write D.R.Y. stylesheets.  D.R.Y. stands for "Don't Repeat Yourself," and by introducing
                        features normally found in programming languages, Sass helps reduce the amount you actually have to write while styling your
                        sites.</p>

                    <section id="where">
                        <h2 class="sectionTitle">
                            <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-question-sign"></span>
                            Where can you use <span class="sass-emphasis">Sass</span>?
                        </h2>
                        <p>The compiled results of a SCSS (<em>Throughout this how-to I will refer to Sass and SCSS interchangably</em>) stylesheet can
                        be used anywhere that normal CSS can be used, because it <em>is</em> normal CSS. In order to get the compiled results of a SCSS
                        stylesheet, you need the Sass compiler.</p>
                        <p>The Sass compiler was originally written in the Ruby programming language, but thanks to the hard work of some talented individuals,
                        Sass has been ported to a C/C++ library known as <a href="http://www.sass-lang.com/libsass" target="_blank">LibSass</a>.  The beauty of LibSass is that
                        it not only speeds up the compilation of SCSS stylesheets (estimated to be <a href="http://www.moovweb.com/blog/libsass/" target="_blank">4000x faster</a>),
                        but it also enables integration with myriad other programming languages through wrappers written in the target integration language.  Want to
                        use Sass with Node.js? <a href="https://github.com/sass/node-sass" target="_blank">No problem!</a>  Interested in using Sass with C?  <a href="https://github.com/sass/sassc" target="_blank">
                        Easy!</a>  How about PHP?  <a href="https://github.com/sensational/sassphp" target='_blank'>Yup!</a>  As you can see, Not only is Sass useful, but LibSass
                        makes it incredibly portable and perfet for integrating into any of your projects.</p>

                                <a href="#" target="_blank">Part one</a> of this guide will cover the setup process.  We'll look at getting the Ruby version of Sass installed as well as the LibSass
                                library up and running using the Sassc command line wrapper.  Additionally, we'll ensure that you've got everything you need to build
                                and run a Node.js based web-server that uses Sass. If you're just interested in learning the basic syntax, you can skip this page alltogether.

                                <a href="#" target="_blank">Part two</a> will cover the basics and the syntax of the SCSS (Sassy CSS) version of Sass. (There's an older and outdated version)
                                that doesn't use brackets but we won't be covering that here.)  Here's where the rubber meets the road.  You'll learn about variables, mixins,
                                nesting, partials, importing, partials, operators, and more.  After completing this section, you should know enough to be dangerous and really
                                begin experimenting with the potentials that Sass has to offer.

                                section will be the most technical of them all, so if you're only in it for the basics, feel free to skip this and come back later when you feel
                                ready.

                                <a href="#" target="_blank">Part four</a> will take a brief look at using the node-sass wrapper with LibSass.  This is by no means a comprehensive tutorial on
                                LibSass or node-sass but is intended to illustrate the ways that LibSass can add portability and extensability to vanilla Ruby based Sass.
