                very interesting and you should keep on reading because there is a lot that
                you can learn from doing so. Did you know that coffee starts it life in a
                small tree like shrub.  First, the beans look like a red and green oblong
                cherry and are known as a <span class="key-word">Coffee Cherry</span>. After
                being picked from the tree, the thick skin and pulp from the Coffee Cherry
                are removed through either a wet process or a dry process method.  What
                follows is some unrelated code for you to look at:</p>
                <code class="example-code">
                    userName@somePlace ~> ls -la <br>
                    ... <br>
                    userName@somePlace ~> pwd <br>
                </code>
                <p class="post-text">Here is some concluding text to wrap up the post.
                In order to make the post more relevant and cool, I'll include a final image
                and my "signature" which will help you think I'm a much more authentic person.</p>
