                                and the <a href="https://github.com/sass/sassc" target="_empty">SassC</a> wrapper.  As was mentioned previously, LibSass is a C/C++ rewrite of
                                the Sass engine that provides insanely faster stylesheet compilation.  Additionally, through the use of wrappers, LibSass makes
                                writing and using Sass stylesheets a more portable option than the native Ruby library.</p>
                                <p>For our purposes, LibSass will enable us to demonstrate using Sass in the context of a Node.js application and the SassC wrapper
                                will provide us with the ability to test and confim that we've got LibSass actually working on our system.  Let's begin the install:</p>

                                <h3>Step 2: Verify LibSass / SassC Installation</h3>
                                <p>Enter the following into your terminal.  If your output matches, you're good to go!</p>

                                <p>If your version for SassC and LibSass is reported as [NA], do not fear!  SassC depends on Git for grabbing its version information.  Sometimes, despite your
                                best efforts, it can't find Git even when its on the path.  To test your installation, create a new file called <em>"test.scss"</em> that contains the following
                                code (<em>don't worry if it doesn't make sense to you yet</em>):</p>

                                <p>Now, in the same directory as the file you created, enter the following into your terminal (<em>this assumes that sassc is on your system path!</em>):</p>
