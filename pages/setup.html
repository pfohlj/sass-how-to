                                <p><em>When you install Ruby, it includes <code>gem</code>, which is the Ruby package manager.</em>  Type the following into your terminal

                        <p>For this section you're going to be installing / configurint the <a href="https://github.com/sass/libsass">LibSass</a> library
                        and the <a href="https://github.com/sass/sassc">SassC</a> wrapper.  As was mentioned previously, LibSass is a C/C++ rewrite of
                        the Sass engine that provides insanely faster stylesheet compilation.  Additionally, through the use of wrappers, LibSass makes
                        writing and using Sass stylesheets a more portable option than the native Ruby library.</p>
                        <p>For our purposes, LibSass will enable us to demonstrate using Sass in the context of a Node.js application and the SassC wrapper
                        will provide us with the ability to test and confim that we've got LibSass actually working on our system.  Let's begin the install:</p>
                        <br><p><strong>Please note:</strong> Getting this up and running on a windows system requires that you have Visual Studio Express 2013 or Desktop 2013
                        installed.  If you don't have a copy, head <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/post-download-vs/?sku=community&clcid=0x409&telem=ga#">here</a>
