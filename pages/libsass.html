                        <!-- Basic Introduction to the material -->
                        <p>
                            In this section, we're going to step away from our focus on Sass syntax and look at how we can use Sass outside
                            the context of our own command line.  We're going to do this by looking at a LibSass wrapper known
                            as Node-sass.  As you might have already guessed, Node-sass is a wrapper that acts as middleware between a Node 
                            server and the LibSass library.  It is highly suggested to follow along with this, typing in each chunk of code
                            as we go.  For that reason, you should ensure that you've completed the <a href="setup.html" target="_blank">Setup</a> process and
                            that you can access LibSass via SassC on the command line.
                        </p>

                        <!-- Bullet point what will be covered -->
                        <p>
                            On this page, we'll be covering the following:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Part 1</strong>: Getting a basic Node server up and running.</li>
                                <li><strong>Part 2</strong>: Using Node-sass to compile .scss files.</li>
                                <li><strong>Part 3</strong>: Displaying our results in the browser.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>

                        <!-- Quick wrap up("When you're finished...") and motivation for continuing -->
                        <p>
                            Once you've finished this section, you'll have created a working app that compiles SCSS to CSS on the server, and
                            then sends that to the browser.  You should have a better understanding of the potential that LibSass and its various
                            wrappers offer, and you should be ready to jump into using them in your own projects.

                                <br>
                                <p>
                                    Now that you've got your package.json built, you need to install express.js and Node-sass as dependencies of the
                                    app.  Express is a lightweight Node framework that will make setting things up a LOT easier, so lets install that
                                    first:
                                </p>

                                <pre><code class="language-bash">npm install --save express</code></pre>

                                <br>
                                <p>
                                    After running that command, you should have a node_modules file created in your current directory and should also 
                                    be able to see a new dependency for express in your package.json file.  Installing node-sass is <em>almost</em>
                                    as easy.  If your on a Max / Linux system, you should be able to run:
                                </p>

                                <pre><code class="language-bash">npm install --save node-sass</code></pre>

                                <p>
                                    If you're in windows, Node-sass requires Visual Studio 2013 WD.  Because you already installed SassC using Visual
                                    Studio, you should be all good here, but if you have multiple versions installed, the alternate command you should use to 
                                    install Node-sass on Windows is:
                                </p>

                                <pre><code class="language-bash">npm install --save --msvs_version=2013 node-sass</code></pre>

                                <br>
                                <p>As long as all of those installs went well, you can move on to building out your server.</p>

                                <h3>Building our basic server code</h3>

                                <p>
                                    To begin building our basic server code, you'll need to create a file with your favorite text editor called app.js
                                    in the root of your project dirctory (<em>where you ran <code class="language-bash">npm init</code></em>).  The file
                                    should contain the following code:
                                </p>

                                <em>// app.js</em>
                                <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-javascript">var express = require('express');
<!--                         -->var app = express();
<!--                         -->
<!--                         -->app.get('/', function(req, res) {
<!--                         -->    res.send('Hello World!');
<!--                         -->});
<!--                         -->
<!--                         -->app.listen(8080, function() {
<!--                         -->    console.log('Node-sass app listening on port 8080!; Press Ctrl-C to terminate.')
<!--                         -->});</code></pre>

                                <br>
                                <p>
                                    Lets quickly walk through our code.  Lines 1 and 2 are importing the express module and creating the app variable.
                                    Lines 4-6 setup the default route (When GET requests are made without any extra info) to return the text "Hello World!".
                                    And lines 8-10 set the app to listen for GET requests on port 8080.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Running our server</h3>

                                <p>Go back to your terminal, make sure your in the same directory where your app.js file is, and type the following in:</p>

                                <pre><code class="language-bash">$ node app.js</code></pre>

                                <br>
                                <p>If there's no problem you should see the following in your terminal:</p>

                                <pre><code class="language-bash">Node-sass app listening on port 8080!; Press Ctrl-C to terminate.</code></pre>

                                <br>
                                <p>Now open your browser and navigate to <a href="http://localhost:8080" target="_blank">localhost:8080</a> and you shold see a blank page
                                with the text "Hello World!"</p>

                                    As you should be able to see, there are three new additions.  The first occurs on lines 2 and 3, where we not require 
                                    <code>node-sass</code> and <code>fs</code>, which is a build in node module for accessing the server's file system.  The second addition occurs on
                                    lines 9 and 10.  Each of these variable definitions is creating a string which represents the absolute path to the file
                                    we'll be reading from (<code>in_file</code>) and the file we'll be writing to (<code>out_file</code>).  The
                                    <code>__dirname</code> expression is built into node and returns the directory of the .js file it is called in.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Finally, lines 13-28 represent the meat of this section.  On line 13 we call the <code>render</code> function and then on lines 14-15 we
                                    pass it a javascript object containing options that the render function uses.  The two options that we are passing in for
                                    this function call are <code>file</code> (the .scss file we'll be reading from), and <code>outFile</code> (the file we want
                                    to write to). On line 16, we then pass in a callback function which takes an error object and a result object.  If there was
                                    not an error (<em>line 17</em>), we then call the <code>writeFile</code> method of the fs object we created earlier, passing it the file
                                    to write to, the css attribute of the result object, and another callback function.  It is at this point that the file should
                                    be written to your file system.  The lines inside this callback simply report wether or not that was done successfully.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Writing some Sass</h3>

                                <p>
                                    To test our new server code, we need to create a .scss file that it can compile, and as the code above indicates, that file should
                                    be called test.scss.  You should create a new file called "test.scss" in the same directory as your app.js file and in that file,
                                    use the following code:
                                </p>

                                <em>// test.scss</em>
                                <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-scss">$some-variable: red;
<!--                         -->.random-class-name {
<!--                         -->  background-color: $some-variable;
<!--                         -->}</code></pre>

                                <h3>Verifying Sass compilation</h3> 

                                <p>
                                    Now that you've got your server updated and a .scss file written, lets test our code.  Head to your terminal, make sure you're
                                    in the same directory as app.js, and run the following.  Your output should match what you see here:
                                </p>

                                <pre><code class="language-bash">node app.js
<!--                         --></code>Node-sass app listening on port 8080!; Press Ctrl-C to terminate.</pre>

                                <p>
                                    Now head to your browser and open <a href="http://localhost:8080" target="_blank">localhost:8080</a>.  You should still see the "Hello World!" 
                                    message but in addition to that, when you return to your terminal, you should see the following output:
                                </p>

                                <pre><code class="language-bash">Sass compiled and written to file.</code></pre>

                                <p>
                                    If you get any other messages, either that compilation failed or that writing the file failed, go back and check that your 
                                    code matches what is above.
                                    Also, run the following in your terminal to ensure that you've actually got LibSass and SassC on your system's PATH:
                                </p>

                                <pre><code class="language-bash">$ sassc -v</code></pre>

                                <p>
                                    If that doesn't work for you, head back to the <a href="setup.html" target="_empty">Setup</a> page and ensure that you followed the directions
                                    there properly.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    You should also check the folder where your .scss file was originally and ensure that a new CSS file named test.css was created.
                                    If it's there, open it in your text editor and verify it's contents look like this:
                                </p>

                                <em>// test.css</em>
                                <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-css">.random-class-name {
 <!--                        -->  background-color: red; }</code></pre>

                                <p>
                                    If that's what you see, then congratulations, you've successfully written a server based app that uses the Node-sass LibSass
                                    wrapper!  While that's cool and all, we still want to display the results of our work in the browser, so lets move on to the
                                    next part.
                                </p>

                                    In the final part of this section, we'll take a look at how to display what we've done in the browser.  While it's nice that
                                    we can compile using the Node-sass wrapper, that doesn't do anything that we couldn't already do with the default command line
                                    tool.  In order to complete this last section, we're going to have to make a few more modifications to the server side code:

                                    As you should be able to observe, the new additions occur on 30-34 and on lines 37-42.  The first set of
                                    additions enables us to start serving html documents instead of just plain text.  First, on lines 30-32, I
                                    create an options object containing the path to the root of the current directory.  This is necessary
                                    otherwise the <code>sendFile</code> method doesn't know where to look for the file it is sending.  Next, on
                                    line 34, I send the index.html file (<em>we haven't created this yet</em>) and pass in the options object along
                                    with the file name.

                                <p>
                                    The next change to the file occurs on 37-43.  Because we want to style our web page with a .css file, we have to find 
                                    a way to send that file from the server to the web page.  Normally, if we were using a templatin engine (<em>beyond the
                                    scope of this tutorial</em>), we might output the CSS directly into the html document.  In this case, we need to create
                                    a new GET route to respond to the browsers request for the .css document.  That's exactly what we do on line 37.  After
                                    that, the pattern is exactly the same, except that we send the file test.css instead of index.html.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Creating a basic HTML file and some new Sass</h3>

                                <p>
                                    In order to use our server the way that we now have it configured, we need to create the index.html file.  
                                    Additionaly, we're going to want to modify our test.scss file so that it does something a little moore interesting.
                                    You should now open your text editor and create a new file called index.html.  Also, re-open test.scss and then ensure that
                                    both files match what you find below:
                                </p>

                                    Now that you've got your html written and your Sass spiced up, you can test everything out
                                    by firing up your shiny new server.  You'll want to open your terminal and <code>cd</code>
                                    to your project's directory.  Once there, type in the commands as they appear below, and 
                                    visit <a href="http://localhost:8080" target="_blank">localhost:8080</a> in your browser.  Your command line
                                    output should match what you see below: 
                                </p>

                                    like the following image.

                                    At this point, you've built a working Node.js app that uses the Node-sass middleware to compile .scss files
                                    using the C/C++ LibSass library.  You should feel proud of yourself.  It's also possible that you're reading
                                    this and you haven't had such success.  If that's the case, don't worry yourself!  Sometimes it takes time to
                                    really get this stuff.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    If you tried you best and still couldn't get the app working, you can execute the following commands to download
                                    a copy of the code featured in this part of the how-to, install the required dependencies, and run the app.  
                                    If your problems were with bad JavaScript, HTML, or SCSS syntax, this will help root them out. <em>Note: this will not 
                                    fix any issues related to LibSass or SassC not being accessible on your system PATH.</em>

                                    At this point, you know more than enough to use Sass effectively in any context.  The only place to go from here is
                                    to the official documentation for more learning.  On the next page you'll find links to further reading and docs.
